## 🚀 About Me

I am an Architect transitioning into AI & Machine Learning, with a strong foundation in structured problem-solving and analytical thinking.

I build end-to-end Machine Learning and NLP applications, focusing on real-world use cases such as media bias detection, demand forecasting, healthcare prediction, and intelligent document retrieval (RAG).

My goal is to design scalable, practical AI systems that bridge domain knowledge with data-driven intelligence.

Currently deepening expertise in:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- AI-powered web applications using Streamlit
